# Benchmarking Automated Cell Phenotyping Methods in Spatial Porteomics.(spCell-Eval)

We present, "spCellEval Benchmark", a quantitative comparison of automated/semi-automated cell phenotyping methods for Spatial Proteomics datasets on a diverse set of curated public datasets. The methods are compared with a list of label transfer metrics divided into 4 categories; classification performance, distribution recovery, stability and scalability. We hope this benchmark acts as a foundation to evaluate and improve automated cell phenotyping.
